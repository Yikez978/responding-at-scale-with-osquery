# Special Capabilities
## File Integrity Monitoring
## Yara

---

# File Integrity Monitoring
- Specify directory paths and wildcards
- Creates an inotify watcher
- Publishes changes to file_events table

---

# File Integrity Monitoring
## Specify paths to watch
```javascript
"file_paths": {
    "configuration": [
      "/etc/%%"
      ],
    "binaries": [
      "/usr/bin/%%",
      "/usr/sbin/%%",
      "/bin/%%",
      "/sbin/%%",
      "/usr/local/bin/%%",
      "/usr/local/sbin/%%",
      "/opt/bin/%%",
      "/opt/sbin/%%"
    ],
    "ssh_keys": [
        "/home/%/.ssh/authorized_keys"
      ]
  }
```

---
# File Integrity monitoring
```javascript
osqueryd[22331]: message=Added kernel listener to: /usr/bin/
osqueryd[22331]: message=Added kernel listener to: /usr/sbin/
osqueryd[22331]: message=Added kernel listener to: /bin/
osqueryd[22331]: message=Added kernel listener to: /sbin/
osqueryd[22331]: message=Added kernel listener to: /usr/local/bin/
osqueryd[22331]: message=Added kernel listener to: /usr/local/sbin/
osqueryd[22331]: message=Added kernel listener to: /opt/bin/
osqueryd[22331]: message=Added kernel listener to: /opt/sbin/
osqueryd[22331]: message=Added kernel listener to: /etc/
osqueryd[22331]: message=Added kernel listener to: /home/
```

---

# File Integrity Monitoring
## Write a scheduled query to collect
```javascript
"schedule": {
    "file_events": {
      "query": "select * from file_events;",
      "interval": 900,
      "removed":false
    }
  }
}
```

---
# File Integrity monitoring
```javascript
{
  "name": "file_events",
  "hostIdentifier": "ip-172-31-28-89",
  "calendarTime": "Tue Nov  3 19:53:38 2015 UTC",
  "unixTime": "1446580418",

# Yara
## A pattern matching syntax for identifying malware
## osquery can be configured to compare changed files to a set of yara sigs
## This is a beta feature at this time

---
# Yara
## Start by setting up the file paths you want to watch just as before.
```javascript
"file_paths": {
    "binaries": [
      "/usr/bin/%%",
      "/usr/sbin/%%",
      "/bin/%%",
      "/sbin/%%",
      "/usr/local/bin/%%",
      "/usr/local/sbin/%%",
      "/opt/bin/%%",
      "/opt/sbin/%%"
    ]
  }
```

---
# Yara
## Then tell osquery which files contain yara sigs.
- Note the key, "binaries" has to be one of the file paths
```javascript
"yara": {
  "signatures": {
    "group_1": ["/path/file1.sig", "/path/file2.sig"],
    "group_2": ["/path/file2.sig", "/path/file3.sig"]
  },
  "binaries" : ["group_1"]
}
```

---
# Yara
## Since this is still beta, we aren't using this in production.
## Only in exploration right now.
## No idea what performance impact this has on a server.

# Managing Intelligence with Packs

# What Are Packs

---

# Why Packs?
---

# Building Your Own Packs

---

# Using Non-Facebook Packs

---

## ? Performance Impact & Testing ?
- heavy queries and how to avoid them
  - Might need to ask Mike/Teddy
- query profiler
- cgroups

---
# cgroups
## Control Groups: a feature of the linux kernel
- LXC uses cgroups to do it's work
- Allows you to segment a group of processes into their own process space or file system

---
# cgroups
## Root cgroup - everything runs here
- by default everything gets 1000 cpu shares
- smallest you can provide is 2 shares

  - ad hoc queries
- Introducing Windmill
- logging pipeline
